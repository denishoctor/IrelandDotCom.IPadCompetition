A simple iPad website built using Sencha Touch 0.94 that was used to run a competition from Ireland.com in Sept 2010.

The screen loads with a map asking the user to find a location. They can zoom and pan around the map and when they tap a map pin appears. They then click done. This brings up a modal/overlay asking for name and email. This info and the lat/lng are written to a simple text file on the server in CSV format.

Clean and simple!
